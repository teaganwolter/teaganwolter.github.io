             <p class="h7">This course is periodically taught as one of UChicago’s Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations’ 
               introductory archaeology sequence. As the instructor for this course, I created my own syllabus for the course, 
               including selecting readings and creating assignments that would be appropriate for both graduate and undergraduate students.
                I also created my own lectures and arranged a guest lecturer for one session.</p>

               <p class = "h5">Humanities Writing Seminars</p>
               <p class = "h7">Humanities Writing Seminars are courses taught alongside UChicao’s Humanities Core classes,
                  which are required for all first-year students. I was responsible for creating my own writing curriculum for the students, 
                  delivered in the form of two small-group seminars and one round of one-on-one meetings for each section. 
                  Small-group seminars consisted of a short lecture on a writing topic, along with examples of techniques to help students
                   critique their own writing. This would be followed by directed peer critique of a sample of writing provided by each student.
                    The final one-on-one meetings were less structured and catered to each student’s needs. </p>

                   Barrington Area Public Library, discussed the process of archaeological discovery through the example of the Bactria-Margiana
                  Archaeological Complex. The lecture can be viewed on YouTube <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFWCeNk7apc'>here.</a>

                   served as a general overview of the origins of sedentism and agriculture in the ancient Middle East.
